**Michael Knott, Strength & Conditioniong Coach and an aspiring Python Developer**

I love solving performance questions related to sports performance. I'm currently on a journey to learn Python to solve more complex problems. In my current projects I'm using Django, Playwright and BeautifulSoup with a touch of htmx and Chart.js

I’m keen to explore how other sports practitioners are using Python within their day-to-day practice in support of improving performance. 

Please contact me if you'd like to collaborate or have information to share.
